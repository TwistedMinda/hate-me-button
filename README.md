### Objective

Players join a game where they're paired up randomly. They have to pick the same number as their partner to keep their money. If they don't, their money is given to those who did.

## Game Stages:

*Pairing Phase (00:00 AM - 11:59 AM UTC):*
  - Players stake 10 FTM to participate.
  - Participants are randomly paired by the system. Multiple entries are allowed.

*Discussion and Selection Phase (12:00 PM - 11:59 PM UTC):*
  - A set of 8 numbers is displayed to the paired players.
  - They discuss to reach an agreement on one number from the set.
  - Players then individually and secretly submit their agreed-upon choice.

*Resolution Phase:*
  - Pairs with matching choices retain their stakes.
  - Pairs with mismatched choices lose their combined 20 FTM, which is redistributed among the successful pairs.
  - Gains are claimable at any time

## Website Mechanics:

- Pairing Stage: Players enter and await their random pairing, with each pair represented by a box.
  - Discussion Stage: Each box displays:
  - The set of 8 number choices.
  - A chat area for paired discussion.
  - A submission button for players to lock in their choice.
